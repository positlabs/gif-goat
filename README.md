# gif-pal

An app for making gifs that don't suck.

Uses ffmpeg palettegen and paletteuse filters to create higher quality gifs.



## install dependencies

`npm run install`



## run dev

`npm start`



## Notes

- gifsicle bins are pulled from the npm package, so for now, need to build platforms natively (mac, win, linux). Could probably pull out this logic into a build process and local module.

- Mac app identifier: DLG2VT3336.com.positlabs.gifgoat
